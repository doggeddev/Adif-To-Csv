# Adif-To-Csv

This project was specifically created to address and issue with retrieving ADIF log files from the 
http://www.hamclubs.info site. 

The HamClubs site is shutting down sometime next year, and is no longer actively maintained.

I created this parser to download all of our ham radio club log files from the site, then convert 
the ADIF format into a CSV file.

This is a work in progress and will likely change over the coming weeks/months.
